# OpenFPGA-Physical 
A scalable physical design framework for tileable FPGA architectures provides all the required functionality, from generating Verilog netlist using the OpenFPGA framework to implementing a final tapeout-ready GDS layout.

## How to use OpenFPGA-Physical
This repository contains all the extensible base scripts for netlist_generation, design restructuring, place and route, and signoff.
To design an FPGA fabric, please clone the following tapeout template repository, which contains  *openfpga-physical* repository as a subtree.
[OpenFPGA-Physical-Tapeout-Template]()

Please read [How to contribute to the Document's OpenFPGA Physical]() section to understand how to keep in sync with the updated scripts.


## Documentation
